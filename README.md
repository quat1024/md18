A lighting mod hmmm?????
=======================

Dazzle is a Minecraft mod that adds way more lights and lamps than you will ever want or need. Made for ModOff 2018 while completely ignoring the theme.

Featuring:
 - Four types of lamps, coming in all 16 colors. (Two are animated!)
 - Digital/analog versions of those lamps.
 - Regular/inverted versions of those lamps.
 - A redstone light sensor.
 - Particle light flashes.
 - Panel lights, that project light in a line up to 45 blocks in front of the panel.
 - Dim redstone torches.
 - More things as I can think of them!

**This is the post-compo branch**, created to continue working on the mod after ModOff but before judging, because I am an impatient bastard. The version of the mod exactly as it was created during ModOff is available on the `lights` branch.
